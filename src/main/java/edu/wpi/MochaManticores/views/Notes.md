#Notes
## Internal Transportation Services
* Good job
    * I had to change a few things in order to connect the fx:id to the elements  
    nothing major
      
##External Transportation Services
* Nice work
    * Didn't change anything except extending the form class
    
##Floral Delivery
* Nice
    * I didn't change anything
    
##Food Delivery
* Wow! This is wonderful, and you've left space to add on functionality
    * The only suggestion I have is change the confirmation page to a popup/dialog  
    becuase we want to keep the fxml and controller files manageable
      
##Sanitation Services
* Looks good
    * Nice job with the look of the form  
    * Didn't change anything except extending the form class
    
##Emergency Button
* I tried a popup/dialog concept let me know what you guys think
    * I wanted to mess with an auto dismissing confirmation popup, and I think  
    Danilo is looking into something similar so maybe we can collaborate on that
    * I tried to keep scenes to a minimum by using the visibility parameter
